            <h2>Problem of Practice</h2>
            <p>One of the Calls to Action that remains unanswered is Call to Action #53, which calls for the establishment of a National Council for Reconciliation. Despite promises, progress has been slow, limiting accountability and tracking of Reconciliation efforts.</p>
            <p>The issue is that without a formal, independent body, there is no systemic way to ensure progress is made toward true Reconciliation.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="solution">
            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p>To address this, the government should establish and fund an independent National Council for Reconciliation with Indigenous leadership. This council should regularly publish reports, track progress, and hold the government accountable for fulfilling all TRC Calls to Action.</p>
            <p>Our target audience includes policymakers, educators, and the general public who must be informed and motivated to push for this change.</p>

        <section id="media">
            <h2>Media Piece</h2>
            <p>To amplify our message, we have created a Public Service Announcement video that highlights the importance of the National Council for Reconciliation.</p>
            <video width="100%" controls>
                <source src="psa_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p>Our PSA combines visuals, speech, and text on the screen to persuade audiences about the need for accountability in Reconciliation.</p>

        <section id="reflection">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Through this project, we explored the gaps in Reconciliation efforts and how a lack of accountability hinders progress. Our research and media production reinforced the necessity of Indigenous-led oversight.</p>
            <p>By incorporating persuasive techniques, multimodal elements, and factual research, our project encourages meaningful dialogue on advancing Reconciliation in Canada.</p>
